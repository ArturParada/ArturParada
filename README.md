<h2 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, My name is Artur, and I am a software tester with several years of experience. In my role, I have tested web and mobile applications, as well as BTS stations with 5G/4G radio access technology, both in terms of software and hardware. I have written automation tests in JavaScript/TypeScript using WebDriverIO and executed test suites using the Robot Framework. Currently, I am developing my skills in Cypress, which you can check out on my GitHub profile &#128521; </h2>
